                <p>Sneakers have become a lot more than just a kind of footwear, as they are now an essential part of an influential subculture. Sneaker culture finds its roots in African American culture of the 1980s and currently is experiencing a second rebirth. The rise of the Internet and the trend of blurring the line between formal and casual clothing making it socially acceptable to wear what people want in any circumstances. The subculture has become a driving force for manufacturers to design and produce more sneakers making a substantial profit.
